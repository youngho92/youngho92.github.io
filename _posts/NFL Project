### 0. Project Motivation

Fantasy football is a game in which the participants serve as the general managers of virtual professional gridiron football 
teams. The competitors choose their team rosters by participating in a draft in which all players of a real football 
league are available. Points are based on the actual performances of the players in real-world competition.
