### 0. What is Fantasy Football?
<br>

Fantasy football is a game in which the participants serve as the general managers of virtual professional gridiron football teams. The competitors choose their team rosters by participating in a draft in which all players of a real football league are available. Points are based on the actual performances of the players in real-world competition and the participant who have earned the most points will be a winner. The procedure is as follow.

<li>Each player’s performance is related to the player’s fundamental talent and temporary condition.</li>
<li>Each team’s performance is related to the team’s fundamental capacity and temporary condition.</li>
