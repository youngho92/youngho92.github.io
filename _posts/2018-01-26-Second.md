### 0. What is Fantasy Football?
<br>

Fantasy football is a game in which the participants serve as the general managers of virtual professional gridiron football teams. The competitors choose their team rosters by participating in a draft in which all players of a real football league are available. Points are based on the actual performances of the players in real-world competition and the participant who have earned the most points will be a winner. The procedure is as follow.

<b>1-1. Assumptions</b>

I assumed that the expected performance is not only dependent on the fundamental capacity, but also on the temporary condition. The detailed assumptions are as follow.

<ul>
<li>Each player’s performance is dependent on the players’ talent and the team’s capacity.</li>
<li>Each player’s performance is related to the player’s fundamental talent and temporary condition.</li>
<li>Each team’s performance is related to the team’s fundamental capacity and temporary condition.</li>
</ul>

### 2. Data

I acquired the NFL statistics from <a href="http://https://www.footballdb.com/">football database.</a> The raw data is divided into three data sets based on the types of each positon's features.

<style type="text/css">
  table {
    margin-left: 0;
    margin-bottom: 24px;
    border-spacing: 0;
    border-bottom: 2px solid black;
    border-top: 2px solid black;
}
table th {
    padding: 3px 10px;
    border-top: none;
    border-left: 1px solid black;
    border-right: 1px solid black;
    border-bottom: 1px solid black;
}
table td {
    padding: 3px 10px;
    border-top: none;
    border-left: 1px solid black;
    border-bottom: none;
    border-right: 1px solid black;
