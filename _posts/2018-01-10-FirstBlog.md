### Project Motivation

This project was designed to improve data acquisition, data manipulation, data visualization, and data analysis skills with Python.


### Project Description

Our client, WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. As WTWY is a new and vibrant organization, they want to fill the event with people passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology. They want us to optimize the placement of the street team so that they can gather the most signatures, especially who are willing to attend and donate to the organization.
