### Who am I?

I am an aspiring data scientist with the practical skills in data acquisition, data visualization, machine learning, and big data management. I majored in Financial Engineering at Columbia University, completed my Master's degree in December 2017 in order to become a quantitative analyst in the finance industry. 

However, I have been a witness to the transformation of the finance industry by the data science megatrend. And in light of this, I decided to become a data scientist after finding traditional methods such as stochastic modeling, optimization, and simulation that I learned from my graduate program in Financial Engineering being far from this change. Currently, I am investing my time honing my skills in data science, analytics and machine learning to be able to adapt to the fast-changing demands of the industries.
