### Who am I?

I am an aspiring data scientist with the practical skills in data acquisition, data visualization, machine learning, and big data management. I majored in financial engineering at Columbia University and completed my Master's degree in December 2017.

Since I came to NY, I have been a witness to the transformation of the finance industry by the data science megatrend. And in light of this, I decided to become a data scientist after finding traditional methods such as stochastic modeling, optimization, and simulation being far from this change.
